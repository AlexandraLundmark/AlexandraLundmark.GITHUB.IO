# Hello World!

My name is AlexandraLundmark.

In the course Computer Science for Mathematicians at Stockholms University we have worked with GitHub. In GitHub we co-operate with different versions of code when we do decelopment in Pyton. 
But we also created a small web pages - This is my first own website ever. 


```In this bow I will have some links to articles. But first I must do some smaller tests. [Testlänk till Naturskyddeföreningen.](https://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/)```
