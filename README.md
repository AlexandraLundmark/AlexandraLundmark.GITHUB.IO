# Hello World!

My name is AlexandraLundmark.

In the course Computer Science for Mathematicians at Stockholms University we have worked with GitHub. In GitHub we co-operate with different versions of code when we do decelopment in the programminglanguage Pyton. 
But we have also created a small web pages - This is my first own website ever.
