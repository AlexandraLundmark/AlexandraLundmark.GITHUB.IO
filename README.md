# Hello World!

My name is Alexandra Lundmark.

## About me

- I have worked as a high school teacher, *gymnasielärare*, in mathematics and science since the spring of 2009.

- I have two children born in 2013 and 2015 and I had a parental leave of one year with each of them. 

- This semester I study Programming Techniques at Stockholms University. 

- In the evenings I prefer to watch a good zombie movie/series with my husband or work out at the gym. 


### Here are some Swedish articles from various integration projects that I participated in during my parental leave:
- [Swedish for baby](http://www.pressreader.com/sweden/tidningen-%C3%A5rsta-enskede/20151121/textview)
