# Hello World!

My name is AlexandraLundmark.

In the course Computer Science for Mathematicians at Stockholms University we have worked with GitHub. In GitHub students co-operate writing different versions of code when we do decelopment in the programming language Pyton. 

This site was built by me using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### About me
I have worked as a high school teacher (Swedish *gymnasielärare*) in mathematics and science since spring 2009.

I have two children born 2013 and 2015 and I had a parental leave of one year with both my children. 

This semester I study Programming Techniques and Computer Science for Mathematicians at Stockholms University. 


Here are some articles from various integration projects that I participated in during my parental leave:
