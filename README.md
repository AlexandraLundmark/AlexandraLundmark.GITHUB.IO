# Hello World!

My name is Alexandra Lundmark.


This site was built by me using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
In the course Computer Science for Mathematicians at Stockholms University we have worked with GitHub. In GitHub we co-operate writing different versions of code when we do decelopment in the programming language Pyton. 




## About me

- I have worked as a high school teacher, *gymnasielärare*, in mathematics and science since the spring of 2009.

- I have two children born 2013 and 2015 and I had a parental leave of one year with each of them. 

- This semester I study Programming Techniques (7.5 hp) and Computer Science for Mathematicians (7.5 hp) at Stockholms University. 

- In the evenings I prefer to watch a good zombie movie/series with my husband or work out at the gym. 


### Here are some articles from various integration projects that I participated in during my parental leave:
